## Introduction
This project involved the design and implementation of a **First-Person View (FPV) Remote-Controlled (RC) Car**. The goal was to retrofit a toy-grade RC chassis (Bezgar 17) with a modern microcontroller system to enable wireless control and real-time video streaming directly to a smartphone.

**What I did in this project:**
* Replaced the original control electronics with a **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3 Sense**.
* Designed a custom **hybrid motor driver system** using high-current and precision drivers.
* Created an **embedded web server** hosting a dual-joystick interface for control and video streaming.
